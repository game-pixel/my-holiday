My Holiday
A day at the beach
An outing with family

On my birthday, I went to the beach with my family.We went there by car.I brought toys and games to play.My brother and I built sandcastles and swam in the sea. We also went fishing. My dad caught a huge fish!After that we sat on cozy chairs and enjoyed the scorching but relaxing sun.I spotted a few mountains and islands while looking at the empty horizon.It was a truly mythological event.

The beach

The beach is a perfect place to have a party, go fishing, and best of all, relax.It's soothing sun and breath-taking horizon will put you in awe of the beach.The beach is spacious and perfect to lay down a mat and get tanned, and the port is greatly exquisite to go fishing for huge fish.

After That...

My birthday party

After that exhausting day, I went to my house and I celebrated my birthday. There was balloons and food and a Spongebob cake waiting for me at the table.I watched some TV and I recieved a phone and a basketball hoop for my presents.
